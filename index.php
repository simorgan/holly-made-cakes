<img class="holly-image" src="images/holly.jpg" alt="Picture of holly, infront of a sign displaying the Holly Made Cakes logo">
<p>Let me introduce myself. I am Holly an enthusiastic and ambitious 24-year-old baker.
 Cooking and baking has always been a big part of my life, with family get togethers 
 always based around what we’re going to eat. At 16 I attended Bath College to study
  catering and hospitality, alongside working at a local farm shop. Jumping at any chance 
  to make the cakes served in the farm shop café, I quickly realised my real passion was in baking. <br>
After a few years of working in different kitchens I decided it was time to take the plunge and start 
my own cake business. With lots of support from my family along with the opportunity to supply Meadgate Farm Shop with my cakes, <span class="inline-title-background"> <span class="inline-title">Holly Made</span> <span class="inline-title-cake" > Cakes</span> </span>was born.
